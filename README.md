# Homepage
 ## -Hello, hi!
My name is Pavlo and this is my website-resume.  
I've decided to host it with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), because it's easy, comfortably, safely, and saves my time. It's free so you can use it just sigh in and enjoy. 

**Open** [Pavlo Paitak](https://pavlopaitak1998.github.io/homepage/index.html) and you can see my resume. 

## Getting started

1. *Open up [**GitHub**](https://pages.github.com/) and sign in*

2. *Create a new repository named homepage*

3. Create two projects — **Homepage** and **Resume** (use Kanban (Automated) as a project template for both). Here are the corresponding descriptions of them: 
- **Homepage: Make homepage great!** Make it responsive, accessible, informative, credible, readable, descriptive, compatible, consistent, uncluttered, simple, secure, up-to-date. Alternatively, just give up.
- **Resume:** A typical résumé contains a "summary" of relevant job experience and education, as its French origin implies. The résumé is usually one of the first items, along with a cover letter and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential employer sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants. The goal of this project is to create an online version of the résumé using HTML, CSS, and the minimum amount of JavaScript.

4. From now on all the tasks should be listed in the projects. Meanwhile, take a look at the Markdown.

5. Add topics (e.g. "pesonal website homepage resume gh-pages html css binary-studio-academy bsa18")

6. Update **README.md** (psst, don't forget to add this as a task to Homepage project; but hey, also convert to issue while you're at it)

7. Create a new branch based on **master**

8. — Hey, c'mon, are you even trying?! I've asked you to put tasks into projects, so puh-leeeeeze! (all right, skip the issue this time)

9. Go see the settings for the repository, lock **master** away, default to **develop**

10. Collect the necessary information (official start of the "Resume" project) — it would be very nice if you could utilize GitHub's Labels and Assignees features at this point.
- **Make a timeline** 
Make a list of all (important) vital events, celebrities, achievements, periods that give a pleasant and unpleasant experience, etc. In this particular case, there are no long lists; instead, they are badly rolled up, so we pack everything here in succession, and the "superfluous" events can be kept silent later on. The list should be systematized and sorted in such a way that the reader quickly understands the "pattern" and could easily navigate the space and time of this summary.
- **Make an intro**
Make an intro (introduction), where in 2-4 sentences describe what you are doing, what you like to do, what you want to do better, what it is important to do, and so on.
Make contact information block
Links to social networks (Facebook or Instagram, others), phone number or email address, and more. Maybe not all of the links in the world, but only those that are really relevant.
- **Скласти додаткові інформаційні блоки**
You can make the summary less formal by adding additional blocks that contain useful information but present it in an "entertaining" form. For example, what you like and do not like, strengths and weaknesses, a list of skills or hobbies, infographics or interactive modules, etc. It is worth writing the content of this block before starting the layout, because its size will affect the placement of elements on the page.
- **Choose leyout** 
Choose page layout. Inspiration can be drawn from the works of [Bill Mowney](https://dribbble.com/bilmaw), for example. It is worth picking up the placement of items on a page, which will look like a resume to be equally enjoyable on the screens of computers and mobile devices that are on paper after printing.

11. Create **index.html** (just copypaste http://htmlshell.com/, but set the title to "%username% — Résumé")

12. Upgrade your **<head>** (use [HEAD](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) for reference, keep your work in a separate branch, see [GitFlow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) and [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) for reference). After you do this — feel free to poke around with the branches, maybe learn something new.
Let's take a pause and be a caveman for a second — or a hacker, if you will — let's go and see how it looks like for the guys without graphical user interface (use _git clone_, _git branch_, _git checkout_, _git log_, _git status_). Let's also add a fake contact information into the **<head>** (use _git add_, _git commit_, and _git push_).
  
13. Use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository on your PC and update your <head>. Push it to the remote, check the changes and create your first Pull Request. Meanwhile it's safe to delete the **feature/head** branch, because it was successfully merged into **develop**.
  
14. Add "— Hello, world!" into the **body**
  
15. Merge into **master**, setup GitHub Pages

16. Finish the project with your data. Not necessarily this should be the resume of a member of the academy - another character will come up with something to say about - mom, dad, Tony Stark, Andrés Iniesta, Donald Trump, etc.
