        <div class="content mylifeway ">
           <p>I was an ordinary lazy and silly boy who went to school only to tease 
the children and bring the teachers off. I had terrible marks. It all 
lasted up to fourteen years, then my mom gave me to a tutor in mathematics.</p>

<p>The tutor inspired me and opened my eyes, showed that only those succeed  
who learns a lot and have a purpose in their life which they are inspiredly going to.</p>

<p>Two months later I improved my mathematical assessment to excellent and 
then all the subjects which I studied were <span class="web">as easy as it is</span> for me.</p>

<p>Every subject I saw as a task for solving which it was necessary only 
to understand the essence, find something interesting for myself and 
make a plan which makes it easy to study.</p>

<p>After the ninth grade I went to the Physics and Mathematics Lyceum. 
I wasn't the smartest, so I improved other traits. I became more 
attentive and more pedantic to what I was doing, more courageous, 
inventive and trickier.</p>
 
<p>After lyceum I went to the NULP on Applied Mathematics. 
During the first year I performed 10 times more tasks 
than others and finished my first course perfectly, 
but realized that everything was in vain, it was obsolete. 
I decided to work hard on something that could feed me in the future.</p>

<p>I began to study English carefully because I always dreamed about going to USA.
I managed to do this and at the end of the second year I flew to USA.</p>

<p>I was for three months in the USA . I worked hard, I was washing the 
dish was a lifeguard and worked as a cook. It was really exhausting.
But I had a goal to earn 10000 dollars during this time and 
therefore I always looked for something interesting in each job 
and did everything very well. 
I quickly liked the managers because of my hard working and then I always
got overtimes. </p>


<p>Three months later I earned $ 10,000 and came back to Ukraine.
After this trip, I realized that I don't want to work hands. 
I started to learn programming. I was very curious how 
everything working there and it always motivates me.</p>


<p>I got acquainted with C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, ASP.NET MVC FUNDAMENTALS, ENTITY, for 
six months.</p>

<p>And now I went to the courses to consolidate my knowledge in practice and get a job.</p>
